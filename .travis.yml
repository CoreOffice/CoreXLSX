# this runs the tests the second time, but it's the only way to make sure
# that `Package.swift` is in a good state and `swift test` can only generate
# coverage reports in Swift 5.0, see this issue for more details:
# https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/1787
# FIXME: this will fail until we can restrict deployment target for SwiftPM to 
# macOS 10.11, which is probably possible with Swift 5.0 after this change
