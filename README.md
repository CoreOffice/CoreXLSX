## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

Model types in `CoreXLSX` directly map internal structure of XLSX format with
more sensible naming applied to a few attributes. The API is pretty simple:

```swift
import CoreXLSX

guard let file = XLSXFile(filepath: "./categories.xlsx") else {
  fatalError("XLSX file corrupted or does not exist")
}

for path in try file.parseWorksheetPaths() {
  let ws = try file.parseWorksheet(at: path)
  for row in ws.sheetData.rows {
    for c in row.cells {
      print(c)
    }
  }
}
```

This prints every cell from every worksheet in the given XLSX file. Please refer to the
[`Worksheet` 
model](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/CoreXLSX/blob/master/Sources/CoreXLSX/Worksheet.swift)
for more atttributes you might need to read from a parsed file.

If you stumble upon a file that can't be parsed, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/CoreXLSX/issues) posting the exact
error message. Thanks to use of standard Swift `Codable` protocol, detailed errors are
generated listing a missing attribute, so it can be easily added to the model enabling 
broader format support.

## How does it work?

Since every XLSX file is a zip archive of XML files, `CoreXLSX` uses 
[`XMLCoder`](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder) library and standard `Codable`
protocols to map XML nodes and atrributes into plain Swift structs. 
[`ZIPFoundation`](https://www.github.com/weichsel/ZIPFoundation) is used for 
in-memory decompression of zip archives. A detailed description is [available 
here](https://desiatov.com/swift-codable-xlsx/).

## Requirements

* Xcode 10
* Swift 4.2
* iOS 9.0 / watchOS 2.0 / tvOS 9.0 / macOS 10.11  

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for
managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build
system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking
dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `CoreXLSX` as a dependency is as
easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/CoreXLSX.git", 
           .upToNextMajor(from: "0.3.0"))
]
```

### CocoaPods

CoreXLSX is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'CoreXLSX'
```
### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

Carthage can be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Inside of your `Cartfile`, add GitHub path to `CoreXLSX`:

```ogdl
github "MaxDesiatov/CoreXLSX" ~> 0.3.0
```

Then, run the following command to build the framework:

```bash
$ carthage update
```

Drag the built frameworks (including the subdependencies `XMLCoder` and `ZIPFoundation` into your Xcode project.
