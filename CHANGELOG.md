# 0.6.1 (May 9, 2019)

Bugfix release that adds `case externalLink` to `Relationship.SchemaType`
improving .xlsx compatibility.

# 0.6.0 (May 2, 2019)

This is a bugfix release with changes to the model API that improve
compatibility with files containing formulas and varied shared string formats.

Specifically:

* new `struct Formula` added with a corresponding property on `struct Cell`
* property `color` on `struct Properties` became optional
* `properties` on `struct RichText` became optional
* new `chartsheet` case added to `enum Relationship`
* `richText` on `struct SharedStrings` became an array, not optional

# 0.5.0 (April 18, 2019)

This is a release with API additions and bug fixes. 

This release of CoreXLSX can be integrated as a Swift 5 module if you're using
Xcode 10.2, but support for Swift 4.2 and earlier Xcode 10 versions is also
maintained. 

Compatibility is improved for big files and files that internally contain
namespaced XML. A few other previously reported compatibility issues are now
fixed. Many thanks to everyone who reported the issues, the improvements in this
release wouldn't be possible without your contribution!

## Breaking changes

Several properties on the model types became optional when there's no
guarantee they are always available in files generated by different apps and 
tools.

## Additions

Now you can parse style information from the archive with the new
`parseStyles()` function. Please refer to the [`Styles`
model](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/CoreXLSX/blob/master/Sources/CoreXLSX/Styles.swift)
for more details. Please note that not all XLSX files contain style
information, so you should be prepared to handle the errors thrown from
`parseStyles()` function in that case.

# 0.4.0 (February 7, 2019)

This is a release with API improvements and bug fixes. A big thank you to everyone
who provided bug reports and contributions that made this release possible!

## Breaking changes

* A few properties on the model types were added with cleaner names and better
fitting types. Most of the old versions of those properties were kept as
deprecated, but you might get some breakage with optionality, where we
couldn't find a good deprecation path.

## Additions

* New `parseSharedStrings` function on `XLSXFile` allows you get values of
cells with shared string value. Quite frequently those strings are
unavailable and are only referenced in the original model types you get with
`parseWorksheet`.


* Previously when addressing cells and columns you had to use a stringly-typed
API. It was also not very convenient for specifying a range of columns. This
is now fixed with the new type-safe [`ColumnReference`
struct](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/CoreXLSX/blob/cf0c7f44e8bf80fdd60fa12b3aa27a15cc79ef86/Tests/CoreXLSXTests/CellReference.swift#L61),
which conforms to `Comparable` and `Strideable`.

* Following the addition of [an error context to
`XMLCoder`](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder/pull/46), which is the main
dependency of `CoreXLSX`, it is now exposed on `struct XLSXFile`. Pass a
non-zero value to `errorContextLength` argument (default is `0`) of `XLSXFile`
initializer and you'll get a snippet of XML that failed to parse in the debug
description of the error value.

* Additional optional argument `bufferSize` was added to `XLSXFile` initializer as
a response to [previous
reports](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/CoreXLSX/issues/27) about problems [with
zip file extraction](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/CoreXLSX/issues/26). The
default value is 10 MiB, which seems to be enough in most cases, but you can
still try passing a larger value for bigger files if you see that an XML file
stops abruptly in the middle of the file. Unfortunately, we haven't found a good
way to adjust this value dynamically based on the file size, but a sufficiently
large value should work for all files, which is the default.

* Support for Carthage was added as well as support for tvOS and watchOS.

## Bugfixes

Some files that couldn't be previously parsed should now be handled better
thanks to fixes in optionality and more properties added to the model types.
